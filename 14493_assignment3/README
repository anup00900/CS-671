HOW TO USE :

First enter the sentences that you want to test on in the file sentence.txt, separated by newline and without fullstop at the end.
Sample sentences are already present in the file sentence.txt.

Then open the terminal in the current folder and from the terminal, enter the following command:
python convert_grammar.py grammar.cfg grammar.cnf sentence.txt

This converts the grammar to CNF form and also includes the POS tags for the test sentences into the grammar.
 
Then from the terminal, enter the following command:
python parse.py sentence.txt grammar.cnf

This should produce the desired output on the screen if your test sentences comply with the grammar.
